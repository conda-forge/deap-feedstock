  description: |
    DEAP is a novel evolutionary computation framework for rapid prototyping and testing of
    ideas. It seeks to make algorithms explicit and data structures transparent. It works
    in perfect harmony with parallelisation mechanism such as multiprocessing and SCOOP. The
    following documentation presents the key concepts and many features to build your own
    evolutions.
